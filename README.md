# Basic Gameplay

You play a character who's on vacation and looking to relax as much as possible.

You start the game in the morning and try to fill your relaxation meter by spending as much time resting in chairs as possible. Relax in a chair and your meter goes up. Spend time out of a chair, and the meter goes down. If you fill the relaxation meter before the day ends, you win!

Along the way, however, you'll face some impediments:
* You have hunger and bladder meters that fill over time. If either gets too full, your relaxation meter goes back to empty. Each level has snackbars and washrooms at which you can drain the hunger and bladder meters, but to use those you have to get out of your chair, causing your relaxation meter to slowly drain and possibly losing a good seat.
* There are other beach-goers who are also looking for a relaxing day. They'll lay down in empty chairs, and in general make it tough for you to find a spot to relax. Some will even kick you out of the chair you're in!

Luckily, you'll also have some help:
* Power-ups such as drinks appear at random and will add a little boost your relaxation meter or decrease your other meters.
* Some chairs are especially luxurious and increase your relaxation at a faster rate than the regular chairs.
